description: "For the book by Alasdair Gray see The Book of Prefaces\nA Book of Prefaces\
  \ is H. L. Mencken's 1917 collection of essays criticizing American culture, authors,\
  \ and movements. Mencken described the work as \"[My] most important book in its\
  \ effects upon my professional career.\" In fact, the book was considered vitriolic\
  \ enough that Mencken's close friend Alfred Knopf was concerned about publishing\
  \ it because of the massive increase in patriotism during World War I in America.\n\
  The book was short, a brief eighty pages divided into four essays. The four subjects\
  \ included Theodore Dreiser, Joseph Conrad and James Gibbons Huneker.\nBut perhaps\
  \ the most important, and certainly the most outspoken essay was entitled \"Puritanism\
  \ as a Literary Force,\" during which he alleged that William Dean Howells, Henry\
  \ James, and Mark Twain were victims of the Puritan spirit.\n\"The Puritan's utter\
  \ lack of aesthetic sense, his distrust of all romantic emotion, his unmatchable\
  \ intolerance of opposition, his unbreakable belief in his own bleak and narrow\
  \ views, his savage cruelty of attack, his lust for relentless and barbarous persecution\
  \ â€“ these things have put an almost unbearable burden up on the exchange of ideas\
  \ in the United States.\"\nMencken had criticized Puritanism for many years, famously\
  \ characterizing it as \"the haunting fear that someone, somewhere, may be happy,\"\
  \ but through World War I his criticism became increasingly outspoken, in part due\
  \ to the rising tide of Prohibition.\nMencken's book triggered the imagination of\
  \ a famous American author. As a teen first entering the world of reading and books\
  \ in the early 1920s, Richard Wright found literary inspiration in A Book of Prefaces.\n\
